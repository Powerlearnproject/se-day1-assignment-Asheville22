#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing,building,testing and maintaining software applications that act as a foundation for creating reliable and efficient software solutions,  important to the technology industry by providing a strucured method to build complex digital systems across  various platforms and devices hence solving a problem or satisfying a technological need.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Birth of Software Engineering which was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in response  to the software crisis-a period when software development faced significant challenges in cost overruns,issed deadlines and poor quality.This milestone marked the beginning o structured software development methodolgies.

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming(1980s-1990s) revolutionised software development .Languages like C,C++ and Java introduced the concept of inheritance and encapsulation making software more reusable and maintainable.OOP became the foundation of modern  software development.

The Agile Revolution (2001-Present) which transformed software engineering by promoting continuous improvement.It prioritized flexibility,iterative dvelopment,customer collaboration and rapid delivery.It was published in response to the limitations of waterfall methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.Problem identification- involves defining,analyzing and understanding the problem the software being developed will solve
2.Planning- involves defining the project goals,scope and requirements.This stage involves  gathering information on what the software should do.
3.Desgning- This includes using specifications and coming up with the general outlook of the software and how it can best be used by a user.
4.Implementation-This is where the software code is written based on the design specifications
5.Testing and debugging- This is where the software is tested using different methods to ensure it gives the right output and meets user needs
6.Deployment-This involves releasing the software to end-users,which may involve providing user training
7.Maintenance- This involves addessing new problems that may come up,adding new features and debugging where necessary.This is the longest stage in SDLC.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology follows a linear sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next begins.This emphasizes thorough plannig and minimizes changes during development.Its strength lies in its predictability and ease of management for projectts with well-defined,stable requirements. for example;building a large-scale infrastructure project eg a road where detailed plans and specifications are crucial.

Agile methdology is iterative,prioritizing flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements.It involves short development cycles with frequent feedback and adjustment.The iterative nature allows for continuos improvement and adaptation to user needs.for example;making a system that would identify all employees in a company and their information.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer- Designs,codes and tests individual components of a software application.Translates software requirements into a functional code.Debugs the software.Ensures the code meets user need

Quality Assuarance Engineer-Ensures quality and reliability of the software.Develops and executes test plans.Indentifies and reports bugs in the software.Verifies that the software meets specified requirements.

Project Manager-Responsible for overrall planning,execution and completion of software development project.Ensurres the project stays on track,within budget and meets the defined quality standards.Coordintes the efforts of the developer and QA engineer,resolving conflicts and ensuring effective collaboration.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

a)IDEs provide a comprehensive suite of tools within a single application,streamlining  the coding process.Features such as code completion,debugging tools and intergrated compilers or interpreters drastically reduce development time and effort.Examples of IDEs are Eclipse for Java development,PyCharm for Python development 

b)VCS are essential for managing changes to source code over time.They  allow developers to track modifications,revert to previous versions and collaborate effectively on projects.Can allow multiple developers  to work concurrently effectively  on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes.Examples of VCS are Git,Mercurial and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1.CHALLENGE;The ever-evolving landscape of technology.The emergence of new programming languages,frameworks and tools is problematic to software engineers.   STRATEGY; Engaging in continuos learning   through online courses,conferences,coding communities and hands on projects.

2.CHALLENGE;The pressure to deliver software quickly can  lead to rushed development and poor code quality.    STRATEGY; Implementing Agile methodology,automate testing and use of CD pipelines

3.CHALLENGE; Software is a common target for cyber threats and vulnerabilities  can lead to loss of data.   STRATEGY; Follow secure coding practices,implement encryption and stay updated on security batches.

4.CHALLENGE;Requirements can be ambiguous making it hard to maintain the project.    STRATEGY;Use Agile methodologies and maintain clear documentation.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
